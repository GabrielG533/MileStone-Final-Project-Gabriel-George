# MileStone-Final-Project-Gabriel-George

This project involves analyzing Netflix content using a dataset that includes movie or TV show titles, ratings, genres, whether they are Netflix Originals or licensed content, and their release years. The goal of the project is to clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming the data for easier analysis. After cleaning, the project examines trends in viewership between Netflix Originals and licensed content over time. It also analyzes ratings and the popularity of different genres to understand viewer preferences better. Graphs, such as line plots and bar charts, are used to visualize comparisons between Netflix Originals and licensed content, helping to provide insights into the platform's content strategy. The cleaned dataset is saved, making it accessible for further analysis and exploration.
