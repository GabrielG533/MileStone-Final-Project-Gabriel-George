It would then involve an overview of Netflix content using the dataset containing information on the title of movies/series, rating, genre, whether Netflix Original or licensed, and the year released. Thus, this forms the basis from which the project cleans and prepares this information by replacing values not available, removing duplicates, and changing data into suitable formats for analysis. After cleaning, the project examines the temporal evolution of watching Netflix Originals compared to licensed content. It also examines the rating and popularity of various genres in order to understand the viewer's preference for one over another. Graphs such as line plots and bar charts have been used to show comparisons between Netflix Originals and licensed content to help extract insights related to the content plan of the platform. The cleaned dataset would be saved to later analyze and explore.
